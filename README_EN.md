> **🚀 180+ Premium Icons Included & Constantly Growing...**

This project is dedicated to **ASUS Router** users who seek a deeper level of customization. I aim to provide a comprehensive set of high-quality, visually consistent icons to replace the generic library in the ASUS Router App.

Whether you own a MacBook Pro, a high-end OLED TV, or a complex smart home setup, this project helps your device list move from a "generic industrial look" to a "premium, polished aesthetic."
